    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The air was chilly as Jill and Sam walked home.</p>
    <p>As they walk, the side walk split from the road into a path that went into the dark forest.</p>
    <p>The forest look ominous, but it was late and the two needed to go home in time for supper. The route through the forest would be much quicker and thus they decided to go into the forest.</p>
    <p>The forest got darker and darker, the wind stalled into silence, and less and less the moon light creeped trough the tree line.</p>
